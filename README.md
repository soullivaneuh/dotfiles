# Personal dotfiles

Here is my personal dotfiles and a way to run one command installation.




## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/soullivaneuh/dotfiles.git ~/p/github.com/soullivaneuh/dotfiles
cd ~/p/github.com/soullivaneuh/dotfiles

### Quick install (from Manjaro)

Recommended to get all the needed packages installed for a working desktop OS.

```
curl -L http://manjaro.sulli.cc | sh
```

### Manual

On your home directory (or anywhere else):

```
git clone git@github.com:Soullivaneuh/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
